# Tic Tac Toe

A browser-based version of the classic game with the same rules: the first user to get three tiles in a row horizontally, vertically or diagonally wins!

If at any point during the game you would like to start the match over, just hit the `Reset` button at the bottom of the board.

### To Run Locally
1. Clone the repo to your local machine by typing the following when in your working directory: `git clone git@github.com:ryancharris/tic-tac-toe.git`

2. Move into the directory: `cd tic-tac-toe`

3. To run webpack-dev-server, run `npm run start`, which will start the application in your default browser

### To Build
To build a bundle using webpack, run `npm run build` and the JS / Sass files will be compiled and output in to the `docs/` directory.

### To Add with More Time
1. Allow users to choose their color and/or symbol
2. Use SVG icons instead of font-based psuedo elements
